# Dotfiles

This repo houses my personal [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

## Feature Highlights

- Quick bootstrapping for new MacOS.
- Shell related dependencies managed via [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and
  [Nix Darwin](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin).
- GUI related dependencies managed via [Brew Cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask).
- Home directory symlinks managed via [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Thanks
